    <h1>The Spica Library</h1>
    <hr/>

    <p>Spica is a library of algorithms and data structures written in several languages. The
    contents of this library are intended to supplement the standard facilities of each
    language. This library also provides an opportunity to experiment with "advanced" or unusual
    algorithms and data structures that are not often seen in practice but that are still
    interesting.</p>

    <p>The algorithms and data structures that Spica covers are of the sort found in standard
    texts on the subject. This includes things like lists, trees, hash tables, graphs, sets,
    strings, sorting and searching methods, and so forth. In addition some components that
    support algorithm and data structure development are also included in Spica. For example,
    certain file manipulation, timing utilities, and debugging services are useful in writing
    algorithm test programs.</p>

    <h2>Building Spica</h2>

    <p>The source code for Spica is available via GitHub. The project page (which includes a
    suitable clone URL) is at <a
    href="https://github.com/pchapin/spica"><tt>https://github.com/pchapin/spica</tt></a>.</p>

    <p>The C and C++ components support, at least to some degree, four compilers: Microsoft
    Visual C/C++ on Windows, Open Watcom on the platforms it supports, clang on Linux, and gcc
    on Linux or Cygwin. It is my intention to support the latest versions of these compilers;
    older versions may also work. Some of the C++ components are being updated to use features
    from the new C++ 2011 standard. These components may not compile with all compilers listed
    above.</p>

    <p>In the root of the Spica source tree you will find a Visual Studio solution file, and
    Open Watcom project file, and a Makefile (for clang). A Code::Blocks workspace can be found
    in the C and C++ folders.</p>

    <p>The Ada components are build in their own directory using GNAT. The D components are
    built in their own directory using Digital Mars DMD (language version 2.x). The Java
    components are built in their own directory using the IntelliJ integrated development
    environment. The Python components do not need to be built in the same sense as the other
    languages but they also exist in their own directory.</p>

    <p>The C and C++ components use Doxygen for documentation. The Java components use Javadoc.
    In addition, the C++ components have a few other supporting documents.</p>
