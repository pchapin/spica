/**
 * A simple stopwatch-like class. Objects instantiated from Timer are intended act like
 * stopwatches. They accumulate time (in milliseconds) between when they are started and when
 * they are stopped. They can be reset and restarted just like a normal stopwatch.
 *
 * This class depends on the system clock to measure its time intervals. Although it claims to
 * have millisecond resolution, the actual resolution depends on the system clock. For many
 * systems, the actual resolution will be considerably worse than millisecond granularity. Also
 * if the system clock is changed while a Timer is running, the Timer will become confused.
