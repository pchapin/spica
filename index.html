<h1>The Spica Meta-Library</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Spica is a library of libraries of algorithms and data structures written in several languages.
  The libraries are independent and are separated into subfolders based on the language used.
  These libraries provide an opportunity to practice implementing both standard, "text book"
  algorithms and data structures, and to experiment with advanced or unusual algorithms and data
  structures that are seldom seen in practice, but that are still interesting.</p>

<p>In addition to algorithms and data structures, the Spica libraries sometimes also contain
  other, potentially useful components in support of timing, unit testing, debugging, and other
  things. In that respect the libraries are a catch-all for reusable components that I have found
  useful in my own programming, but that don't seem to fit anywhere else.</p>

<p>This page documents the entire collection of libraries, mostly by pointing to the individual
  library documentation as appropriate.</p>

<h2>The Libraries</h2>

<p>Some of the Spica libraries, particularly the ones that are larger or more mature, exist in
  entirely separate repositories.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pchapin/spicaada">Ada</a> (separate repository)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pchapin/spicac">C</a> (separate repository)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pchapin/spicacpp">C++</a> (separate repository)</li>
  <li>Erlang</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Rust</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes on Building Spica</h2>

<p>Since each folder attempts to be an independent subproject, see the README in a folder for more
  information about building the Spica components in that folder.</p>
