<h1>The Spica Meta-Library</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Spica is a library of libraries of algorithms and data structures written in several
  languages. The libraries are independent and are separated into subfolders based on the
  language used. These libraries provide an opportunity to practice implementing both standard,
  "text book" algorithms and data structures, and to experiment with advanced or unusual
  algorithms and data structures that are not often seen in practice, but that are still
  interesting.</p>

<p>In addition to algorithms and data structures, the Spica libraries also contain other,
  potentially useful components in support of timing, unit testing, debugging, and other things.
  In that respect the libraries are a catch-all for reusable components that I have found useful
  in my own programming; components that don't seem to fit anywhere else.</p>

<p>This page documents the entire collection of libraries, mostly by pointing to the individual
  library documentation as appropriate.</p>

<h2>The Libraries</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ada</li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/pchapin/spicacpp">C++</a> (separate repository)</li>
  <li>D</li>
  <li>Erlang</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes on Building Spica</h2>

<p>The Ada components are built in their own folder using GNAT. The D components are built in
  their own folder using Digital Mars DMD (language version 2.x). The Java components are built in
  their own folder using the IntelliJ integrated development environment. The Python components do
  not need to be built in the same sense as the other languages, but they also exist in their own
  folder.</p>
