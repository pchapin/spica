<h1>The Spica Library</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Spica is a library of libraries of algorithms and data structures written in several languages.
  The libraries are largely independent and are separated into subfolders based on the language
  used. These libraries provide an opportunity to experiment with "advanced" or unusual algorithms
  and data structures that are not often seen in practice, but that are still interesting.</p>

<p>The algorithms and data structures that Spica covers are of the sort found in standard texts on
  the subject. This includes things like lists, trees, hash tables, graphs, sets, strings, sorting
  and searching methods, and so forth. In addition, some components that support algorithm and
  data structure development are also included in Spica. For example, certain file manipulation,
  timing utilities, and debugging services are useful in writing algorithm test programs.</p>

<p>This page documents the entire collection of libraries, mostly be pointing to the individual
  library documentation as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Building Spica</h2>

<p>The C and C++ libraries support, at least to some degree, four compilers: Microsoft Visual
  C/C++ on Windows, Open Watcom on the platforms it supports, clang on Linux, and gcc on Linux or
  Cygwin. It is my intention to support the latest versions of these compilers; older versions may
  also work. Some of the C++ components are being updated to use features from recent C++
  standards. These components may not compile with all compilers listed above.</p>

<p>In the root of the Spica source tree you will find a Visual Studio solution file, and Open
  Watcom project file, and a Code::Blocks workspace file.</p>

<p>The Ada components are build in their own folder using GNAT. The D components are built in
  their own folder using Digital Mars DMD (language version 2.x). The Java components are built in
  their own folder using the IntelliJ integrated development environment. The Python components do
  not need to be built in the same sense as the other languages, but they also exist in their own
  directory.</p>

<p>The C and C++ components use Doxygen for documentation. The Java components use Javadoc. In
  addition, the C++ components have a few other supporting documents.</p>
