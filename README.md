Spica is a collection of libraries of algoritms and data structures written in various
languages. It is intended primarily to be educational but it is also my hope that some of the
components developed here could be useful in real programs.

P.S. Spica, pronounced "spi-kah" is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. I chose that
name because it was short enough to be reasonable to type as a namespace prefix, wasn't too
distracting, and because my zodiac sign is Virgo. You can think of this library as spiking the
standard facilities of each supported language the way one might spike the punch at a party.
