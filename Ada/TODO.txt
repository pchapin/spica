Allegra TODO List
==================

+ The interface to trees is a little awkward... specifically the Lookup procedure. Also does it
  make sense to include some additional primitive operations such as Minimum and Maximum (be
  careful of the names... the ordering relation is a generic parameter).

+ The Splay_Tree package needs to be put into a form that is compatible with the generic Tree
  interface. This is likely to require a lot of reworking.

+ Documentation? I'd like to use AdaDoc for this, but AdaDoc isn't ready for the Ada 2012
  material.

+ Add some more heap and tree types to make the collection a bit more interesting.

+ Fix up the graph type to use Ada 2012 library components rather than GNAT specific components.
