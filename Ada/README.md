Spica/Ada
=========

Spica/Ada is a library of algorithms and data structures written in Ada 2012. It is not intended
to duplicate the facilities of the standard library but rather to supplement the standard
library. When feasible the algorithms and data structures here should be written in a style that
is similar to that used by the standard library to lower the learning curve associated with
using this library.

Most of the contents of Spica/Ada was written by me either as an exercise or to satisfy a
specific programming need in some other project. Nevertheless Spica/Ada stands alone as a useful
library in its own right.
