Allegra
=======

Allegra is a library of algorithms and data structures written in Ada 2012. It is not intended
to duplicate the facilities of the standard library but rather to supplement the standard
library. When feasible the algorithms and data structures in Allegra should be written in a
style that is similar to that used by the standard library to lower the learning curve
associated with using Allegra.

Most of the contents of Allegra was written by me either as an exercise or to satisfy a specific
programming need in some other project. Nevertheless Allegra stands alone as a useful library in
its own right.
