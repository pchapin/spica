class Graph:
    """Representation of a Graph.
    
    Graphs are stored in adjacency list format. Verticies are numbered from 0 to N-1 (where N is
    the number of verticies). All values in the range 0 .. N-1 must correspond to a vertex;
    there are no "holes" in the vertex numbering.
    
    Edges are represented by (remote_vertex, weight) pairs. The "local" vertex is implicitly
    defined by the adjacency list the edge is on. All graphs are directed. If an undirected
    graph is needed add two edges, one in each direction. Algorithms that use this
    representation must take this into consideration.
    
    Edge weights are required. If weights are not needed by the application, a weight value of
    zero (or some other suitable null value) should be used."""
